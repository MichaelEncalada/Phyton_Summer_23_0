# Phyton_Summer_23_0
This is a course of QLAB to introduce to Phyton.


The task is to create an markdown file where each member must place a list of databases that they would like to work with and the description of that dataset. For example:

Alexander
a. Database: Nexus Ministry of Education

b. Information: Data about teachers at the kinder, primary, and secondary levels for the years 2015-2022

c. Interest: I would like to study information on teacher migration within Peru - or any other general idea about a possible research question.

Each group must create their branch named group_#_ass_1_2023 (group_1_ass_1_2023) and save their results in the assignment_1 folder.

And don't forget that your Pull request should be linked to this issue.

Deadline: 01/09/23 18:00.
